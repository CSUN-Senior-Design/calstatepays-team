      <p> My name is Edgar Godoy, I am the team leader of calstatepays. The reason I decided to be a part of this senior design project was due to my interest in cloud computing. The calstatepays project seemed like a perfect opportunity to challenge myself and gain a newfound knowledge on the technologies used in todayâ€™s workforce such as AWS. I hope that with the tools and experience that I learned while working on this project I may be able to demonstrate these new acquired skills to potential recruiters and future interviews.</p>

Some of my interests include cloud computing such as AWS and IT infrastructure automation by using terraform.The reason I decided to be part of the Cal State Pays project is because I believe it was a good opportunity to learn more about AWS and at the same prepare more for the AWS cloud architect certification. I also believe this project was a good opportunity to show my future employer that I have worked in a AWS project.</p>

      <p>My name's Vincent Becerra, I joined the CalStatePays team to learn more about IT and how to use the popular AWS service. The year I joined I had very little knowledge on networks and internet services such as AWS. The Senior Design class as well as other classes helped me with some understanding of the technology and services. After at least dipping my feet into how AWS works I feel I  more confident that I'll be able to learn more on it and similar services that I hope to show to employers and  apply to any future careers.</p>

    <p>I enjoy learning about the services AWS provides and increasing my skills within cloud computing. My interest for cloud computing has increased within the last year, and the CalStatePays project has become a tool to increase my skills. I'm happy to be apart of this team, and hope my new acquired skills can assist me in getting a job after graduation.</p>
